Typography
 1.Bootstrap uses Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, and sans-
serif in its default font stack. 

All body
copy has the font-size set at 14 pixels, with the line-height set at 20 pixels. The <p>
tag has a margin-bottom of 10 pixels, or half the line-height.


2.Headings

All six standard heading levels have been styled in Bootstrap (see Figure 2-1), with the
<h1> at 36 pixels tall, and the <h6> down to 12 pixels (for reference, default body text is
14 pixels tall). In addition, to add an inline subheading to any of the headings, simply
add <small> around any of the elements and you will get smaller text in a lighter color.
In the case of the <h1>, the small text is 24 pixels tall, normal font weight (i.e., not bold),
and gray instead of black:
h1 small {
font-size:24px;
font-weight:normal;
line-height:1;
color:#999;
}

 <h1>heading1<small>headingSmall</small></h1>
    <h2>heading2<small>headingSmall</small></h2>
    <h3>heading3<small>headingSmall</small></h3>
    <h4>heading4<small>headingSmall</small></h4>
    <h5>heinding5<small>headingSmall</small></h5>
    <h6>heading6<small>headingSmall</small></h6>

3.Lead Body Copy
To add some emphasis to a paragraph, add class="lead" (see Figure 2-2). This will
give you larger font size, lighter weight, and a taller line height. This is generally used
for the first few paragraphs in a section, but it can really be used anywhere:

 <div class="container">
        <h1>Inroduction</h1>
        <p class="lead">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur.</p>
    </div>

i.Emphasis
 using the <small> tag 

ii.Bold
To add emphasis to text, simply wrap it in a <strong> tag. This will add font-
weight:bold; to the selected text.

iii.Italics
he <em> tag. The term “em” derives from the word
“emphasis” and is meant to add stress to your text.


note:You might be thinking, why not just use the <b> or <i> tags instead of
<em> or <strong>? In HTML5, <b> is meant to highlight words or
phrases without conveying additional importance—for example, key
terms or names—while <i> is mostly for voice, technical terms, internal
dialogue, and so on.

iv.Emphasis Classes
Along with <strong> and <em>, Bootstrap offers a few other classes

<p class="muted">This content is muted</p>
<p class="text-warning">This content carries a warning class</p>
<p class="text-error">This content carries an error class</p>
<p class="text-info">This content carries an info class</p>
<p class="text-success">This content carries a success class</p>
<p>This content has <em>emphasis</em>, and can be <strong>bold</strong></p>

v.Abbreviations
<abbr title="Real Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr>

Add .initialism to an <abbr> for a slightly smaller font size (see Figure 2-5):
<abbr title="rolling on the floor, laughing out loud">That joke had me ROTFLOL
</abbr>

vi.Addresses
the <address> defaults to display:block;
you’ll need to use <br> tags to add line breaks to the enclosed address text 

<address>
<strong>O'Reilly Media, Inc.</strong><br>
1005 Gravenstein HWY North<br>
Sebastopol, CA 95472<br>
<abbr title="Phone">P:</abbr> <a href="tel:+17078277000">(707) 827-7000</a>
</address>
<address>
<strong>Jake Spurlock</strong><br>
<a href="mailto:#">flast@oreilly.com</a>
</address>



5.Blockquotes
 For best
results, and for line breaks, wrap each subsection in a <p> tag. Bootstrap’s default styling
indents the text and adds a thick gray border along the left side. To identify the source


of the quote, add the <small> tag, then add the source’s name wrapped in a <cite> tag
before closing the </small> tag:
<blockquote>
<p>That this is needed, desperately needed, is indicated by the
incredible uptake of Bootstrap. I use it in all the server software
I'm working on. And it shows through in the templating language I'm
developing, so everyone who uses it will find it's "just there" and
works, any time you want to do a Bootstrap technique. Nothing to do,
no libraries to include. It's as if it were part of the hardware.
Same approach that Apple took with the Mac OS in 1984.</p>
<small>Developer of RSS, <cite title="Source Title">Dave Winer</cite>
</small>
</blockquote>


note:If you want a <blockquote> with content that is right aligned,
add .pull-right to the tag. In addition to the right-aligned text, the
entire blockquote is floated to the right. This creates nice pull-quotes
in your content,


6.Lists

i.Unordered list
remove the bullets from, add
class="unstyled" to the opening <ul> tag 

note:Personally, I hold a strong aversion to using the <br> tag. When I want
a single-spaced line break, I place each line in an unstyled, unordered
list. For example, if you want a condensed address box, like in


ii.Definition list

he <dl> to a horizontal layout, with the <dt> on the left side and the <dd>
on the right, simply add class="dl-horizontal" to the opening tag

note:Horizontal description lists will truncate terms that are too long to fit
in the left column with text-overflow. Additionally, in narrower view‐
ports, they will automatically change to the default stacked layout.


7.table important

If you want a nice, basic table style with just some light padding and horizontal dividers,
add the base class of .table to any table (see Figure 2-13). The basic layout has a top
border on all of the <td> elements:
<table class="table">
<caption>...</caption>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>...</th>
<th>...</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>...</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


Optional Table Classes

These four classes are: .table-striped, .table-
bordered, .table-hover, and .table-condensed.

Condensed table
If you add the .table-condensed class, as shown in Figure 2-17, row padding is cut in
half to condense the table. This is useful if you want denser information.


8.Table Row Classes


.success Indicates a successful or positive action.
 Green
.error
 Indicates a dangerous or potentially negative action. Red
.warning Indicates a warning that might need attention.
 Yellow
.info
 Used as an alternative to the default styles.
 Blue


9 Forms
Optional Form Layouts

1.Search form
Add .form-search to the <form> tag, and then add .search-query to the <input> for
an input box with rounded corners and an inline submit button (see Figure 2-20):
<form class="form-search">
<input type="text" class="input-medium search-query">
<button type="submit" class="btn">Search</button>
</form>


2.Inline form
To create a form where all of the elements are inline and labels are alongside, add the
class .form-inline to the <form> tag
